# Tic-Tac-Toe 

A Tic-Tac-Toe AI that might not win, *but will never let you win the game*, assuming you won't cheat!

The file was initially in a [separate repo](https://github.com/Lrapava/Python-Tic-Tac-Toe-AI), but I decided to include it here as well..


# Examples
```
$ python3 ./main.py
Who starts the game? ( 0 - Human, 1 - Computer )
1
O12
345
678
 - ...
1
OX2
O45
678
 - You've already lost, the rest is just a ceremony!
6
OX2
OO5
X78
 - You've already lost, the rest is just a ceremony!
5
OX2
OOX
X7O
You lose, just as I've predicted!
```
