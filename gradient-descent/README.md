# Gradient descent
My first attempts to implement gradient descent in C++, Python and JavaScript!

The files were initially in a [separate repo](https://github.com/Lrapava/gradient-descent/), but I decided to include them here as well.. 

All 3 programs compute the equation of [the line of best fit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/line_of_best_fit) for hard-coded dummy data using [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).
